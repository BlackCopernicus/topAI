# topAI

**topAI** is a new AI architecture built to preserve systemic stability while optimizing for performance and cost. Unlike traditional statistical models that degrade under recursive feedback or chaotic data perturbation, topAI integrates structural constraints and totemic anchors to ensure stable, interpretable behavior—especially in complex, real-world systems.

## Core Concepts

- **Totemic Constraint**: A fixed reference point used to prevent optimization drift.
- **Topological Memory**: Models remember *structure*, not just sequences—reducing noise amplification.
- **Stability-First Architecture**: Optimization is bound by dynamic stability thresholds to avoid collapse.
- **Cost-Efficient Intelligence**: Lower compute and data requirements than LLMs while maintaining task performance.

## Applications

- Immune system modeling
- Digital risk monitoring
- Chaos-resistant AI governance
- Behavioral optimization
